# Dice_Simulator
A simple dice simulator created as part of my backend learning journey with Python.
Although small, this project helped me reinforce important programming fundamentals that will support my progress toward backend development.

📌 What This Program Does

Lets the user roll predefined dice: d4, d6, and d20

Allows rolling a custom dice with any number of sides

Supports rolling multiple dice at once

Validates user input and handles errors gracefully

Displays clean and organized results in the console

🧠 What I Practiced and Learned

This project was built with the goal of strengthening my foundational skills in Python.
Throughout the process, I practiced and reinforced:

✔️ Function design and modular programming

Separating logic into reusable functions (diceroll, menu, main)

Returning structured data using tuples

✔️ Input validation & error handling

Using try/except to handle invalid input

Preventing the program from crashing due to unexpected user behavior

✔️ Using dictionaries as configuration

Creating a dynamic dictionary to map menu options to dice types

This reflects how routing/configuration works in backend systems

✔️ Control flow and loops

Handling repeated actions with while loops

Managing program flow with condition checking and menu logic

✔️ User interaction in console applications

Designing clear prompts

Handling invalid inputs and user decisions properly

✔️ Clean logic and beginner-friendly structure

Practicing good habits before moving on to databases, REST APIs, and backend frameworks

🎯 Purpose of This Project

This simulator is part of my ongoing practice as I work toward becoming a backend developer.
My current focus is developing:

Clear and structured logic

Error-resistant programs

Clean function architecture

Basic user interaction

Strong coding habits early on
